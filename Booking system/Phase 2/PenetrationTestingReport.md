# Penetration Testing Report
## 1. Introduction:
### Purpose and scope of the report

- This penetration test was conducted to assess the security posture of the registration page. The objective was to identify vulnerabilities and potential security risks that could be exploited by malicious actors.

### Testing schedule and environment

- Testing Date: 6th March 2025
- Testing Environment: UTM + Kali (arm64)

### Scope of testing

- The primary focus was on the registration page to identify security weaknesses.
- The test evaluated authentication mechanisms, input validation, session management, and potential vulnerabilities to web-based attacks.

### Methods and tools used for testing

- Manual Testing: Conducted to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
- Automated Testing: Conducted using ZAP (OWASP Zed Attack Proxy) for vulnerability scanning.


## 2. Summary:
### Key findings and recommendations
- The penetration test did not identify any critical or medium-risk vulnerabilities.
- One informational alert was identified regarding User Agent Fuzzing.

### General assessment of the systemâ€™s security posture.
- The security posture of the system appears to be generally sound, with no high or medium-risk vulnerabilities detected. However, the presence of the informational "User Agent Fuzzer" alert suggests that further review of header inputs might be beneficial to ensure that the application is not leaking sensitive information or behaving unexpectedly based on different User-Agent strings.

## 3. Findings and Categorization:
### ðŸ”´  Red (Critical) Findings:

- **None**: No critical vulnerabilities were identified during the testing.

### ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (Medium) Findings:

- **None**: No critical vulnerabilities were identified during the testing.

### ðŸŸ¢ Green (Low) Findings:

- **User Agent Fuzzer (Informational)**: This alert was triggered based on fuzzing of the User-Agent header. While this is not a direct security threat, it can potentially expose variations in how the application handles different User-Agent strings. It is suggested to review how the application responds to various headers to ensure there is no unintended information leakage or abnormal behavior.
