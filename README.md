| 30.01.2025 | 2 | Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data <br> Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass <br> Lab: Username enumeration via different responses  <br> Lab: 2FA simple bypass | I struggled to get used to Burp Suite operations. However, I learned how SQL injection can manipulate queries to reveal hidden data by modifying parameters. <br> I didn't know that it's possible to log in as an administrator using SQL injection like this. It was an insightful experience to understand how easily such vulnerabilities can be exploited. <br> I learned how username enumeration and password brute-forcing work together in an attack. Identifying the valid username first makes the brute-forcing process much more efficient. <br> I learned how to bypass two-factor authentication by manipulating the URL, accessing the account page without needing the verification code. This showed how URL manipulation can sometimes bypass security measures. |
